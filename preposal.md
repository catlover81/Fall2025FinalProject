# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

Mystery with a romance subplot visual novel with homemade art, music, sound fx, and, of course, code. 
It will have a good and bad ending and a way to organize "physical" pieces of information including photos and notes. 

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

My main g and amazing artist friend Tina Bui (tuu77168@temple.edu, TA: Farnoush Nilizadeh)

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Hope it's okay that we started this project already like a week ago. We need time to make character designs and music and write the entire story and stuff. We are both visual novel fiends so we are very locked in and excited.
