PLEASE SEE THE TOTALLY AWESOME PREPOSAL

ADDITIONALLY, PLEASE ALSO SEE THE TOTALLY AWESOME PROPOSAL

What did we learn for this project?

My project partner and I learned how to work Renpy and we both put our all into our art skills, making the most of each others' strengths while also trying our best with our own art, which led to some brave moments where we tried new things with our art such as shading and perspective. I also learned how to make simple tunes and looped them with Audacity to include in our game as well!

What were the challenges?

Learning the imagebutton mechanic for file exploration was difficult, but not as difficult as attempting to learn the drag and drop system for a planned journal mechanic. Unfortunately, we were unable to figure it out in time for this project, but maybe we'll add it in a future update?

Overall this project was super fun and my partner and I are seriously considering making another visual novel and updating this one in the future! It was a HUGE project that we started back in October when the the final project was announced (though I ripped the parts of the story straight from a fanfic I wrote back in high school so we kinda already had that down-- I HAVE PROOF TOO DON'T WORRY), and we worked on it during break too! I'm so glad we were able to come this far and make as much progress as we did, and I can definitely see myself using the skills I learned here in a future project that I could possibly monetize in the future?
