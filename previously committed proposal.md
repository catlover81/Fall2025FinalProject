# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Take It Easy, Detective Kova!

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A mystery visual novel with a romance subplot about a detective obsessed with catching a phantom thief. The main point of the story, however, isn't the msytery or the romance, but rather the detective coming to terms with his late father's wishes as well as learning to step back and take a break every once in a while.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The goal is for this project to have a mechanic that allows the player to investigate case files as if they were physical-- the player would be able to see a file on their screen adn click on papers in the file and read the information. That information would then be stored in a journal that the players can access. Another mechanic that we would like to add if we have time is a good and bad ending. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Game is released with full story, file investigation, and base sprites and backgrounds.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Game is released with full story, file investigation, two endings, and base sprites and backgrounds

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The full game is released with all the hangout events, self-composed musi and sound effects, sprites with multiple expressions, journal and file investigation mechanics, and two endings.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to lock in hard with drawing and also visit the library to find any books on composing music since I have never done so before. We will also need to learn how to make a screen in the game interactable (for the file nivestigation and information sorting in the journal). Tina and I are both working on the art and coding, I'll try my hand at composing and Tina will try doing sound effects. This is a pretty ambitious project on our end, however, so if we are unable to make our ownn music or sound effects, we will find some online.
