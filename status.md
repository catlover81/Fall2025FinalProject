Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

The entire story has been written out, and we have started transferring the dialogue and options over to the code for the visual novel itself. We have also made progress on all the art (sprites, backgrounds, GUI) and music. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

We have not yet started on the sound effects or implemented the art in the visual novel yet, and we have not yet figured out a specific game mechanic involving imagebuttons and drag-and-drop mechanics. We will get started on those as soon as all the main story and choices are implemented.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

There was a small hiccup on the coding side of things, where some choices weren't registering, but it turned out to be a simple indentation problem, which was easily fixed.
